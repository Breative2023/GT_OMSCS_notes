# Lesson 8

In this lesson we will cover the Unified Software Process starting with _software architecture_ where the goal is to lay the foundation on which to build successful and long lasting software systems.

## Interview With Nenad Medvidovic

Why is software architecture important? Architectural design decisions are really the principal design decisions in a software system because it could have long-term implications if not made correctly. Architectural erosion happens when software grows over time while the architecture of a software system is ignored or poorly designed to begin with.

## What Is Software Architecture

What is **SWA (software architecture)**? Depends on the source but generally software architecture could be thought of as:

- Perry and Wolf: Composed of elements (the what), form (the how), and rationale (the why)
- Shaw and Garland:
  - A level of design that involves description of elements from which systems are built
  - Interactions among those elements
  - Patterns that guide their composition
  - Constraints on these patterns
