# Lesson 5

In this lesson we will focus on requirements and prototyping including requirements engineering activities and object-oriented design.

## Interview With Jane Cleland-Huang

What are **software requirements**? Software requirements provide us a description of what a system has to do. They typically describe functionality of the features that system has to deliver in order to satisfy its stakeholders.

What is **RE (requirements engineering)**? RE covers a number of activities such as:

- Working with stakeholders to discover requirements
- Analyzing discovered requirements to weigh tradeoffs
- Specifications that describe software functionality
- Validation of deliverable
- Requirements management process (change management)

RE includes _engineering_ in the term because it requires a systematic process throughout the whole lifecycle of the deliverable.
