# Lesson 6

Previously we covered requirements engineering. In this lesson we will look into OOD (object oriented design) and UML (Unified Modeling Language) which we will use in the rest of the course.

## Object Orientation Introduction

What is **OO (object orientation)**? Object orientation focuses several key concepts:

1. Data over function
2. Information hiding
3. Encapsulation
4. Inheritance

## Objects And Classes

An **object** is a computing unit organized around a collection of state or instance variables that define the state of the object. Each object has operators which are methods that allow reading and writing instance variables.

On the other hand, a **class** is a template or blueprint from which new objects (instances) can be created.

## Benefits Of OO

Why should we use OO?

1. Reduce maintenance costs
2. Improve development process
3. Enforce good design

## OO Analysis History

At the time OMT (Object Modeling Techniques) were being developed (led by Rumbaugh), scientists (Jacobson and Booch) also began to think about another technique (UML). OMT comprises of data, functions, and control.

## OO Analysis Overview

In OO analysis, we are concerned about defining the data objects first then the functions between each object second. We also look to transfer real world objects into requirements.

## UML Structural Diagrams: Class Diagrams

We will discuss several UML diagrams in this lesson. The class diagram will be one of them. The class diagram is a static, structured view of the system which describes: classes and their relationships.

**Classes** include:

- Class name
- Attributes and their types
- Operations and their types

**Attributes** represent the structure of a class and may be found by:

- Examining class definitions
- Studying requirements
- Applying domain knowledge

**Operations** represent the behavior of a class and may be found by examining interactions among entities.

**Relationships** describe interactions between objects. There are several types of relationships:

- Dependencies (e.g., x uses y)
- Associations/aggregations (e.g., x has a y)
- Generalization (e.g., x is a y)

## Class Diagram: Creation Tips

Below are several recommendations when working with class diagrams:

1. Understand the problem
2. Choose good names
3. Concentrate of the _what_
4. Start with a simple diagram
5. Refine until you feel it is complete
