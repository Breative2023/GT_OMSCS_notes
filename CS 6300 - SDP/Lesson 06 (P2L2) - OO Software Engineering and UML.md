# Lesson 6

Previously we covered requirements engineering. In this lesson we will look into OOD (object oriented design) and UML (Unified Modeling Language) which we will use in the rest of the course.

## Object Orientation Introduction

What is **OO (object orientation)**? Object orientation focuses several key concepts:

1. Data over function
2. Information hiding
3. Encapsulation
4. Inheritance

## Objects And Classes

An **object** is a computing unit organized around a collection of state or instance variables that define the state of the object. Each object has operators which are methods that allow reading and writing instance variables.

On the other hand, a **class** is a template or blueprint from which new objects (instances) can be created.

## Benefits Of OO

Why should we use OO?

1. Reduce maintenance costs
2. Improve development process
3. Enforce good design

## OO Analysis History

At the time OMT (Object Modeling Techniques) were being developed (led by Rumbaugh), scientists (Jacobson and Booch) also began to think about another technique (UML). OMT comprises of data, functions, and control.
