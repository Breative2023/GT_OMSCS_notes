# Lesson 4

This week, we continue the discussion on developer tools. This lesson covers version control systems - particularly Git.

## Interview With John Britton

A **VCS (version control system)** helps developer manage various revisions or versions of source code. Git is one such VCS which can enhance source code management.

## Version Control System Introduction

Why is VCS useful?

1. Enforces discipline
2. Archives versions
3. Maintains historical information
4. Enables collaboration
5. Recovers from accidental deletions or edits
6. Conserves disk space

## Essential Actions

There are several essential actions when it comes to version control:

1. Add
2. Commit
3. Update

## Do Nots In VSC

There are a couple of things we should not do in VCS:

- Do not add derived files (such as executable files)
- Do not add bulky binary files
- Do not use local copies

## Two Main Types Of VCS

There are two main types of VCS:

- **Centralized**: each person works directly with a centralized repository
- **Decentralized**: each person works directly with a forked-copy of the upstream repository and can push final changes to the upstream repository

## Git Workflow

There are several of steps in a Git workflow:

1. Workspace (working directory)
2. Index (stage)
3. Local repository (HEAD)
4. Remote repository
