# Lesson 15

The **agile development process** (also known as **test driven development** or **TDD**) is a software development process which is heavily based on testing. We will also look into two principles of agile software development commonly used in practice:

1. XP (extreme programming)
2. Scrum

## Cost Of Change

In waterfall development processes the cost of change grows exponentially with time. How to combat this issue? Back in the day, one way was to discover errors early with upfront planning.

However, this was around 30 years ago, many things have changed since then and in general the software development process became much faster. Using modern tools, practice, and principles we might be able to _flatten_ out the curve for the cost of change over time.

## Agile Software Development

If cost is flat then upfront work becomes a liability and with ambiguity it may be good to delay, therefore there is value in waiting. There are six principles of agile software development that aim at flat cost:

1. Focus on the code
2. People over process
3. Iterative approach
4. Customer involvement
5. Expectation that requirements will change
6. Simplicity
