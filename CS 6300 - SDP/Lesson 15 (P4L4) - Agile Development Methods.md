# Lesson 15

The **agile development process** (also known as **test driven development** or **TDD**) is a software development process which is heavily based on testing. We will also look into two principles of agile software development commonly used in practice:

1. XP (extreme programming)
2. Scrum

## Cost Of Change

In waterfall development processes the cost of change grows exponentially with time. How to combat this issue? Back in the day, one way was to discover errors early with upfront planning.

However, this was around 30 years ago, many things have changed since then and in general the software development process became much faster. Using modern tools, practice, and principles we might be able to _flatten_ out the curve for the cost of change over time.
