# Lesson 1

This lesson will serve to provide and overview of the entire course then cover questions such as:

1. What is software engineering?
2. Why do we need it?

## Importance Of Software Engineering

There are many takes on the importance of software engineering. Software engineering today involves many stakeholders and engineers working together to deliver technology that meets the requirements of all stakeholders and the customer. Today, software is ubiquitous with everyday life.

## Discipline Of Software Engineering

Why is it so difficult to built good software? To build good software requires:

- Methodologies
- Techniques
- Tools

The deliverable must be a _high quality_ product that _works_ and _fits the budget_.

## The Software Crisis

There were many reasons for the software crisis in the 1960s:

1. The demand for software from 1950 to 2000 grew exponentially
2. The development effort for bigger deliverables (e.g., operating system, distributed system, etc.) became a _software engineering_ effort
3. The software developers' productivity could not keep up with the software size and complexity

## Evidence of the Software Crisis

In 1990, Davis studied nine software development contracts where majority of the budget spent on software ($5M out of $7M) resulted in software that was:

- Delivered but never successfully used
- Not delivered

This study resulted in the NATO software engineering conferences starting in January 1969.

## Software Development

Software development is the process in which an abstract idea becomes a concrete system that implements the abstract idea. For this to happen, an abstract idea must go through several software processes which are:

1. Systematic
2. Formal

Such that many different parts can come together to implement the abstract idea.

## Software Process

There are many different software processes. In this course we will cover:

1. Waterfall
2. Evolutionary prototype
3. RUP/USP (Rational Unified Process/Unified Software Process)
4. Agile

## Software Phases

There are various software phases in the software process:

1. Requirements engineering
2. Design
3. Implementation
4. Verification and validation
5. Maintenance

## Tools Of The Trade

Software tools can help close the gap between developers' productivity and software size and complexity. The main tools we will examine in this class are:

1. IDE (integrated development environments)
2. VCS (version control systems)
3. Coverage and verification tools
