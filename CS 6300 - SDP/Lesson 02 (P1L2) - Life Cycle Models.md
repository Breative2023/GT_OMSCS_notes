# Lesson 2

In this lesson we will go through several software engineering lifecycle models as well as the pros and cons of each. A **software lifecycle** is a sequence of decisions that determine the history of your software.

## Traditional Software Phases

Recall that there are several phases in software:

1. **Requirements engineering**: the process of establishing the needs of stakeholders that are to be solved by software
2. **Design**: consists of various design activities beginning from a high-level of software design to a low-level
3. **Implementation**: the process of taking designs and building out the software; there are four principles of implementation:
   1. Reduction of complexity
   2. Anticipation of diversity
   3. Structuring for validation
   4. Use of external standards
4. **Verification and validation**: e.g., did we build the right system and did we build the system right?
5. **Maintenance**: the process of maintaining the software built; this process also includes:
   - Corrective maintenance
   - Perfective maintenance
   - Adaptive maintenance

## Software Process Model Introduction

The software process model should describe what we should do next and how long we should continue to do it for each activity.

## Software Processes

There are various software lifecycle processes:

- **Waterfall**: a software process that occurs in a linear fashion
  - Pros: finding errors early
  - Cons: this process is not flexible
- **Spiral**: a process that involves several of steps (determine objectives, identify and resolve risks, development and tests, and plan the next iteration)
  - Pros: risk reduction, added functionality, early software delivery
  - Cons: specific expertise, dependent on risk analysis, complex
- **Evolutionary prototyping**: mainly based around prototyping
  - Pros: immediate feedback
  - Cons: difficult to plan
- **RUP (Rational Unified Process)**: is a UML (Unified Modeling Language) based process which includes inception, elaboration, construction, and transition for each activity
- **Agile**: a group of software development methods which are based on highly iterative and incremental development

## Choosing A Model

Choosing the right model for software development depends on many factors below are several to consider:

- Requirements understanding
- Expected lifetime
- Risk
- Schedule constraints
- Interaction with management and customers
- Expertise

## Classic Mistakes

There are several classic mistakes during the software development process:

1. People: heroics, work environment, and people management
2. Process: scheduling issues, planning issues, failures
3. Product: gold plating, feature creep, development that is actually research
4. Technology: silver bullet syndrome, switching tools, no version control
