# Lesson 2

In this lesson we will go through several software engineering lifecycle models as well as the pros and cons of each. A **software lifecycle** is a sequence of decisions that determine the history of your software.

## Traditional Software Phases

Recall that there are several phases in software:

1. **Requirements engineering**: the process of establishing the needs of stakeholders that are to be solved by software
2. **Design**: consists of various design activities beginning from a high-level of software design to a low-level
3. **Implementation**: the process of taking designs and building out the software; there are four principles of implementation:
   1. Reduction of complexity
   2. Anticipation of diversity
   3. Structuring for validation
   4. Use of external standards
4. **Verification and validation**: e.g., did we build the right system and did we build the system right?
5. **Maintenance**: the process of maintaining the software built; this process also includes:
   - Corrective maintenance
   - Perfective maintenance
   - Adaptive maintenance

## Software Process Model Introduction

The software process model should describe what we should do next and how long we should continue to do it for each activity.
