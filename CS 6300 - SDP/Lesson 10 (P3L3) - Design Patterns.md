# Lesson 10

It can be difficult to decide on a design that will best fit our software system. Therefore, in this lesson we will look into _design patterns_ which can help to provide reusability to our software system.

## History Of Design Patterns

The history of design patterns could be summarized as:

- 1977: Christopher Alexander introduces the idea of patterns as successful solutions to problems
- 1987: Ward Cunningham and Ken Beck leverage Alexander's idea in the context of an OO language
- 1987: Eric Gamm's dissertation on importance of patterns and how to capture them
- 1992: Jim Coplien's book, _Advanced C++ Programming Styles and Idioms_
- 1994: Gang of Four (Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides) and their book, _Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software_
