# Lesson 11

In this lesson we will try to combine concepts from software architecture, low-level design, and design patterns with concepts from software engineering activities to discuss a unified software process.

## History Of RUP (Rational Unified Process)

In 1997, Rational defined six best practices for modern software engineering:

1. Develop iteratively, focusing on risk
2. Manage requirements
3. Employ a component-based architecture
4. Model software usually
5. Continuously verify quality
6. Control chances

## Key Features Of RUP

There are several features of RUP:

1. Software process model: includes order of phases and transition criteria
2. Component-based: includes software components and well-defined interfaces
3. Tightly related to UML: related notation and basic principles
4. Distinguishing aspects include: use-case driven, architecture-centric, and iterative and incremental

## Use Case Driven

RUP is use case driven. A system performs a sequence of actions in response to user input. Use cases capture this interaction and answer the question: _what is the system suppose to do for each user?_
