# Lesson 11

In this lesson we will try to combine concepts from software architecture, low-level design, and design patterns with concepts from software engineering activities to discuss a unified software process.

## History Of RUP (Rational Unified Process)

In 1997, Rational defined six best practices for modern software engineering:

1. Develop iteratively, focusing on risk
2. Manage requirements
3. Employ a component-based architecture
4. Model software usually
5. Continuously verify quality
6. Control chances
