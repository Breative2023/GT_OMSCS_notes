# Lesson 11

In this lesson we will try to combine concepts from software architecture, low-level design, and design patterns with concepts from software engineering activities to discuss a unified software process.

## History Of RUP (Rational Unified Process)

In 1997, Rational defined six best practices for modern software engineering:

1. Develop iteratively, focusing on risk
2. Manage requirements
3. Employ a component-based architecture
4. Model software usually
5. Continuously verify quality
6. Control chances

## Key Features Of RUP

There are several features of RUP:

1. Software process model: includes order of phases and transition criteria
2. Component-based: includes software components and well-defined interfaces
3. Tightly related to UML: related notation and basic principles
4. Distinguishing aspects include: use-case driven, architecture-centric, and iterative and incremental

## Use Case Driven

RUP is use case driven. A system performs a sequence of actions in response to user input. Use cases capture this interaction and answer the question: _what is the system suppose to do for each user_?

## Architecture Centric

RUP is architecture centric. Use cases define the function and the architecture defines the form. The process for this may include:

1. Creating a rough outline of the system
2. Translating key use cases into sub-systems
3. Refining architecture using additional use cases

## Iterative And Incremental

RUP is iterative and incremental. Each software project has numerous cycles and each cycle results in a product release. Each cycle is divided into four phases:

1. **Inception** - includes mainly business modeling activities
2. **Elaboration** - includes mainly requirements plus analysis and design activities
3. **Construction** - includes mainly analysis and design, implementation, test, and deployment activities
4. **Transition** - includes some testing and deployment activities

For each phase, there may be multiple iterations.

## Iterations

Within each iteration the following activities may be observed:

1. Identify relevant use cases
2. Create design
3. Implement the design
4. Verify code against use cases
5. Release a product at the end

## Section Quizzes

### UML 1 Quiz

_What is the difference between a use case and a use case model_?

A use case model is a set of use cases.

### UML 2 Quiz

_What are use case diagrams used for_?

- They can be used to prioritize requirements
- They can be used during requirements elicitation
- They can be used for test case design

### Iterative Approach Quiz

_What are the benefits of iterative approaches_?

- Give developers early feedback
- Minimize risk of developing wrong system
- Accommodate evolving requirements
