# Lesson 9

In this lesson we will go through an example where a librarian gives a list of requirements to a software engineer. This is the same set of lectures as [Lesson 08 (P2L5) - Library Exercise (UML)](<../CS%206310%20-%20SA&D/Lesson%2008%20(P2L5)%20-%20Library%20Exercise%20(UML).md>)

## A Tale Of Analysis And Design

To recap, the software analysis and design process is as follows:

1. Analyze requirements
2. Refine classes and attributes
3. Add attributes
4. Identify operations
5. Add relationships
6. Refine relationships
7. Refine the class diagram
