# Lesson 14

In _black-box_ testing we tested a system without knowing the internal details of the system. This lesson will examine _white-box_ (structural) testing which involves the internal details of a system as wells as benefits and drawbacks.

## White-box Testing Overview

In **white-box testing**, the basic assumption is that executing the faulty statement is a necessary condition for revealing a fault.

Some advantages of white-box testing include:

- Can be measured objectively
- Can be measured automatically
- Can be used to compare test suites
- Allows for covering the coded behavior

There are also different kind of white-box testing:

- Control-flow based
- Data-flow based
- Fault based
