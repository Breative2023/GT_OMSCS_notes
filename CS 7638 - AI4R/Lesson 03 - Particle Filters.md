# Lesson 3

In this lesson we will examine a third way to estimate the state of a system known as **particle filters** which are:

> ... Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods are a set of Monte Carlo algorithms used to solve filtering problems arising in signal processing and Bayesian statistical inference. The filtering problem consists of estimating the internal states in dynamical systems when partial observations are made, and random perturbations are present in the sensors as well as in the dynamical system. The objective is to compute the posterior distributions of the states of some Markov process, given some noisy and partial observations. -Wiki

Particle filters have an advantage of being easiest to program and are the most flexible.
