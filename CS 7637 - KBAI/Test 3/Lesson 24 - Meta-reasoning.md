# Lesson 24

In this lesson we discuss **meta-reasoning** which is thinking about thinking (or knowledge about knowledge). Meta-reasoning is not concerned about an agent reasoning to determine an output to the world. Instead, meta-reasoning focuses on an agent's own internal knowledge, reasoning, and learning. We will cover the following:

1. Mistakes in knowledge, reasoning, and learning
2. Gaps in knowledge and reasoning
3. Strategy selection and integration
4. Meta-meta reasoning?
5. Goal-based autonomy

## Mistakes In Reasoning And Learning

Meta-reasoning allows an agent to explore the following:

1. How was this particular knowledge learned?
2. What was wrong in the learning process that led to that particular error?
3. How to fix the learning process such that the same mistakes are not made again?
