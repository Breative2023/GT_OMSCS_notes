# Lesson 24

In this lesson we discuss **meta-reasoning** which is thinking about thinking (or knowledge about knowledge). Meta-reasoning is not concerned about an agent reasoning to determine an output to the world. Instead, meta-reasoning focuses on an agent's own internal knowledge, reasoning, and learning. We will cover the following:

1. Mistakes in knowledge, reasoning, and learning
2. Gaps in knowledge and reasoning
3. Strategy selection and integration
4. Meta-meta reasoning?
5. Goal-based autonomy
