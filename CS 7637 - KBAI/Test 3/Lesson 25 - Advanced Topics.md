# Lesson 25

In this lesson we will discuss a handful of very broad topics and advanced applications of KBAI. We will also touch on some of the connections between human cognition and KBAI.

## Visuospatial Reasoning Introduction

**Visuospatial reasoning** is concerned with reasoning about _what_ (visuo) and _where_ (spatial). Visuospatial knowledge is knowledge where causality is, at most, implicit. However, visuospatial knowledge enables inferences about causality.

## Two Views Of Reasoning

- Propositional representations - representations through frames
- Analogical representations - representations through structural correspondence with the external world

Humans appear to use analogical representations for mental imagery. It is not yet known how to implement mental imagery for KBAI.

## Symbol Grounding Problem

_Content_ refers to the content of knowledge while _encoding_ deals with the representation of knowledge. The table below highlights some differences:

|          | Visuospatial                          | Verbal                                 |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Content  | Appearance: what and where            | Arbitrary: driven by inferential needs |
| Encoding | Analogical: structural correspondence | Propositional: no correspondence       |
