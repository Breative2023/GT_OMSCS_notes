# Lesson 18

**Analogical reasoning** involves understanding new problems in terms of a family of problems and transferring knowledge of relationships from known problems across domains. We will cover the following:

1. Similarity and case-based reasoning
2. Process of analogical reasoning
3. Design by analogy

## Need For Cross-domain Analogy

Cross domain connections allow an agent to solve new problems based on existing knowledge in some domain. An agent will do this by abstracting out relationships between concepts from one domain to another. These relationships are important because they are the knowledge that is transferred from the source case to the target problem.
