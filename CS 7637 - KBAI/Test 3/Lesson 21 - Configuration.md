# Lesson 21

In this lesson we will cover _configuration_ which is a routine kind of design task in which all the components of the design are already known. The task of configuration is to assign values to the variables of those components so they could be arranged according to some constraints. We will cover the following:

1. Design and configuration
2. Plan refinement
3. Connections to earlier topics
