# Lesson 21

In this lesson we will cover _configuration_ which is a routine kind of design task in which all the components of the design are already known. The task of configuration is to assign values to the variables of those components so they could be arranged according to some constraints. We will cover the following:

1. Design and configuration
2. Plan refinement
3. Connections to earlier topics

## Define Design

**Design** takes in needs, goals, or functions and returns the specification and structure of some artifact that satisfies those needs, goals, and functions. The artifact does not need to a physical product, it could be a process, program, or policy.

Design is very broad, open ended, and undefined. In problem solving, typically the problem remains fixed even as the solution evolves. However in design, both the problem and the solution co-evolve (the problem evolves as the solution evolves). One of the goals of KBAI is building intelligent agents which can design.

## Defining Configuration

**Configuration** is a problem solving activity that assigns values to variables to satisfy constraints.
