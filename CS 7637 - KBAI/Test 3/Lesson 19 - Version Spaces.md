# Lesson 19

In this lesson we will cover generalization and learning using _version spaces_. Generalization and learning are closely related to incremental concept learning (learning by one step at a time) which relied on background knowledge. Generalization and learning is useful in cases where background knowledge might not be available. We will also cover the following:

1. Version space definition
2. Abstract version spaces
3. Algorithm for version spaces
4. Identification trees
