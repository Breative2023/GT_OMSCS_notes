# Lesson 8

In this lesson we will look into _learning by recording cases_. This is one of the fundamental elements of KBAI and also the first topic in analogical reasoning. We will cover the following:

1. Learning by recording cases
2. Nearest neighbor method
3. k-Nearest Neighbor
4. Cases in the real world

## Learning By Recording Cases

A **case** is an encapsulation of a past experience. The process for learning by recording cases is as follows:

1. Given a new problem `a`
2. Retrieve most similar prior problem `b` from memory
3. Apply problem `b` solution to problem `a`

## Nearest Neighbor In k-Dimensional Space

Sometimes plotting objects on a two dimensional grid does not outright reveal a clear answer. In this case we use the k-Nearest Neighbor method which utilizes all neighbors to find the nearest distance (most similar) between all neighbors.
