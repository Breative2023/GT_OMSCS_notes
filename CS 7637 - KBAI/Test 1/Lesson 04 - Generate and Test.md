# Lesson 4

In this lesson we will be covering the following topics:

- Generate and test method
- Smart generators
- Smart testers
- Generate and test for Raven's Progressive Matrices

## Guards And Prisoners

KBAI is a collection of three things:

1. Knowledge representations
2. Problem solving techniques
3. Architectures

Referring back to the guards and prisoners problem, a typical _dumb_ generator will generate all possible scenarios and a _dumb_ tester will eliminate scenarios based on specific rules.

## Smart Testers

A smart tester will not only remove scenarios based on rules, it will also check for identical states.
