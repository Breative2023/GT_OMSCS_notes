# Lesson 3

In this lesson we will be covering the following topics:

- Knowledge representations
- Semantic networks
- Problem solving with semantic networks
- Represent and reason

## Representations

Knowledge of representation has two elements:

1. The language
2. The content

E.g., `F = m*a` is an algebraic equation representing Newton's second law.

## Introduction To Semantic Networks

There are several steps to constructing a semantic network:

1. Label each element
2. Label the relationship between each element
3. Label the relationship between initial and final state for each element

## Structure Of Semantic Networks

There are several elements for the structure of semantic networks:

1. Lexically: nodes
2. Structurally: directional links
3. Semantically: application-specific labels

## Characteristics Of Good Representations

What are some characteristics of good representations?

- Explicit relationships
- Natural constraints
- Abstraction (at the proper level)
- Precise details (no extraneous details)
- Transparent, concise, complete, fast, and computable

## Guards And Prisoners Problem

Many names for this problem (cannibals and missionaries, etc.), originally appeared in the 1200-year-old text _Propositiones ad Acuendos Juvenes_. Used throughout AI for problem representation. For more information see:
