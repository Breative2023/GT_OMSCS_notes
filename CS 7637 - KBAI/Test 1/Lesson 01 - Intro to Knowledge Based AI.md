# Lesson 1

In this lesson we will cover the following topics:

1. Conundrums in and characteristics of AI
2. KBAI (knowledge-based AI) and the four schools of AI
3. Cognitive systems
4. Topics in AI

## Conundrums In AI

There are several of conundrums in AI:

1. Intelligent agents have limited resources
2. Computation is local, but problems have global constraints
3. Logic is deductive, but many problems are not
4. The world is dynamic, but knowledge is limited
5. Problem solving, reasoning, and learning are complex, but explanation and justification are even more complex

## Characteristics Of AI Problems

AI problems have many characteristics:

1. Knowledge often arrives incrementally
2. Problems exhibit recurring patterns
3. Problems have multiple levels of granularity
4. Many problems are computationally intractable
5. The world is dynamic, but knowledge of the world is static
6. The world is open-ended, but knowledge is limited

## Characteristics Of AI Agents

Below are some of the characteristics of AI agents:

1. Agents have limited computing power
2. Agents have limited sensors
3. Agents have limited attention
4. Computational logic is fundamentally deductive
5. AI agents' knowledge is incomplete relative to the world

## What Is Knowledge

Knowledge-based AI is a process that involves **reasoning**, **learning**, and **memory**. These three processes are intimately connected and are known as **deliberation**. The deliberation process is one part of the overall architecture of a KBAI agent.

## The Four Schools Of AI

The four schools of AI can be broken down into:

1. Agents that _think_ like _humans_
2. Agents that _act_ like _humans_
3. Agents that _think_ _optimally_
4. Agents that _act_ _optimally_
