# Lesson 6

We will discuss **production systems** in this lesson. Production systems are a kind of cognitive architecture in which knowledge is represented in the form of rules. This is the last topic under the fundamental topics. We will also cover the following:

- Cognitive architectures
- Production systems
- Chunking

## Function Of A Cognitive Architecture

A **cognitive agent** is a function that maps a perceptual history into an action.

## Levels Of Cognitive Architecture

There are various levels of cognitive architecture:

- Low: hardware/implementation level (e.g., brain, transistor)
- Medium: algorithm/symbol level (e.g., means-ends analysis, semantic networks)
- High: task/knowledge level (e.g., selecting a pitch, playing baseball)

The lower levels provide an _architecture_ for higher levels and the higher levels provide _content_ for lower levels.

## Assumptions Of Cognitive Architectures

There are several of assumptions for cognitive architectures:

1. Goal-oriented
2. Rich, complex environment
3. Significant knowledge
4. Symbols and abstractions
5. Flexible and function of the environment
6. Learning
