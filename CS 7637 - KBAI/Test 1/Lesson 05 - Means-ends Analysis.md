# Lesson 5

Not all problems are well-formed but for those that are, another type of analysis which will be useful for us is the means-ends analysis. This lesson will cover the following:

- State spaces
- Means-ends analysis
- Problem solving with means-ends analysis
- Problem reduction

## State Spaces

We can imagine problem solving as occurring in a state space. There is an initial state and a goal state where the goal state consists of all of the states that could be produced from the initial state to fulfill the goal.
