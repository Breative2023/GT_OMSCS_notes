# Lesson 9

In this lesson we will cover topics on _case-based reasoning_ where cognitive agents address new problems by tweaking solutions to similar previously encountered problems. Case-based reasoning builds on top of learning by recording cases. We will also cover the following:

1. Recording cases revisited
2. Need for case-based reasoning
3. Phases of case-based reasoning
4. Advanced case-based reasoning
