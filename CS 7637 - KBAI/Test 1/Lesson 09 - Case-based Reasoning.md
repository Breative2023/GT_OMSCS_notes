# Lesson 9

In this lesson we will cover topics on _case-based reasoning_ where cognitive agents address new problems by tweaking solutions to similar previously encountered problems. Case-based reasoning builds on top of learning by recording cases. We will also cover the following:

1. Recording cases revisited
2. Need for case-based reasoning
3. Phases of case-based reasoning
4. Advanced case-based reasoning

## Recording Cases To Case-Based Reasoning

There are several of steps for case-based reasoning:

1. **Retrieval**: retrieving a case from memory similar to the current problem
2. **Adaptation**: adapting the solution to that case to fit the current problem
3. **Evaluation**: evaluating how well the adapted solution addresses the current problem
4. **Storage**: storing the new problem and solution as a case

## Assumptions Of Case-Based Reasoning

There are several assumptions for case-based reasoning:

1. Patterns exist in the world
2. Similar problems have similar solutions

## Case Adaptation

There are several ways an agent could use case adaptation to solve a problem:

1. Case adaptation by model of the world: use a previous solution or model to adapt and solve a new problem
2. Case adaptation by recursive reasoning: break the new problem into sub-problems then use partial solutions from other problems to solve the new problem
3. Case adaptation by rules: use rules to adapt to a new problem
