# Lesson 2

In this lesson we will go over class goals, outcomes, and strategies, projects, and assignments. There will also be opportunity to dive into computational psychometrics and Raven's Progressive Matrices. Lastly, we will finish up with principles of CS 7637.

## Class Goals

Goals of this class include learning:

- Core methods of KBAI
- Tasks addressed by KBAI
- How KBAI agents use these methods to address these tasks
- The relationship between AI and human recognition

## Class Outcomes

Class outcomes include:

- Designing and implementing a KBAI agent
- Using formal strategies and agents to address complex practical problems
- Using the design and results of KBAI agents to reflect on human cognition

## Class Strategies

We will learn in this class through examples, doing, project-based learning, personalization, and reflection.

## Introduction To Computational Psychometrics

**Psychometrics** is a study of human intelligence, aptitude, and knowledge. **Computational psychometrics** is the design of computer agents that can take the same kinds of tests (intelligence, aptitude, and knowledge) as humans.

## Raven's Progressive Matrices

**Raven's Progressive Matrices** were written in the 1930s to examine general intelligence. The test consists of 60 strictly visual multiple-choice analogy problems. These matrices range from 2x2, 3x3, to even a 2x1 matrix.
