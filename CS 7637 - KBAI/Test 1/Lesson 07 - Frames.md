# Lesson 7

In this lesson we look into _frames_ the first step to building common sense reasoning. We will also cover the following:

1. Function of frames
2. Properties of frames
3. Relationship between frames and previous topics
4. Frames for advanced sense-making

## How Do We Make Sense Of A Sentence

A **frame** is a knowledge structure where a number of things could be happening in a particular knowledge representation. By breaking down a sentence into a frame, we could make more sense out of a sentence.

## Complex Frame Systems

Complex frame systems can be created by adding frames to an already existing frame, e.g., nouns in a sentence.

## Properties Of Frames

The following are properties of frames:

1. Represent stereotypes
