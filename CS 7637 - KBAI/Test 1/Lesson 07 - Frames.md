# Lesson 7

In this lesson we look into _frames_ the first step to building common sense reasoning. We will also cover the following:

1. Function of frames
2. Properties of frames
3. Relationship between frames and previous topics
4. Frames for advanced sense-making

## How Do We Make Sense Of A Sentence

A **frame** is a knowledge structure where a number of things could be happening in a particular knowledge representation. By breaking down a sentence into a frame, we could make more sense out of a sentence.

## Complex Frame Systems

Complex frame systems can be created by adding frames to an already existing frame, e.g., nouns in a sentence.

## Properties Of Frames

The following are properties of frames:

1. Represent stereotypes
2. Provide default values
3. Exhibit inheritance

## Frames And Semantic Nets

Frames and semantic networks are closely related. We can capture the same details as semantic networks in frames by denoting the same information within a frame representation.

## Frames And Production Systems

Referring back to production systems, we can think of frames as conceptual knowledge stored in the semantic memory. Since a frame tells us what to look for, processing is not just bottom up coming from things such as natural language processing but also partially top down as the mind is able to provide a frame of which knowledge could be structured.
