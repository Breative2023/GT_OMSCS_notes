# Lesson 14

In this lesson we will examine an intelligent agent's _understanding_ of events and stories in the world which will build on our frame concepts. We cover the following:

1. Thematic role systems
2. Ambiguity
3. Constraints

## Thematic Role Systems

A **thematic role system** is a type of frame representation system where the frame represents an action or event identified by a verb. In these frames, the verb is able to establish expectations about the roles that are connected to that particular event.

Consider the following sentence:

> Ashok made pancakes for David with a griddle

The frame representation could be as follows:

Thematic Role:

- Verb: make
- Agent: Ashok
- Beneficiary: David
- Thematic object: pancakes
- Instrument: griddle

This frame will allow us to draw inferences which will allow an agent to understand the meaning of the sentence.
