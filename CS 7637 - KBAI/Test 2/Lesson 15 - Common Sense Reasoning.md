# Lesson 15

In this lesson we will examine how we could make an AI agent have common sensical inferences about the world. This wil involve pulling concepts from frame representation. We will also cover the following:

1. Primitive actions
2. Actions and sub-actions
3. State changes

## Primitive Actions

We can start examining how an AI agent might interpret very structurally different sentences that have the same meaning by noting **primitive actions**. These set of basic actions (e.g., move-body-part, move-object, etc.) could help an agent interpret a message as each primitive action has a frame representation associated with it which allows for stereotyping.
