# Lesson 11

In this lesson we will be going over **classification** which refers to mapping sets of percepts in the world into unique classes so that we can take actions in the world in an efficient manner. These classes could be learned through incremental concept learning. We will also cover the following:

1. Equivalence classes and hierarchies
2. Kinds of concepts
3. Bottom-up and top-down processes
