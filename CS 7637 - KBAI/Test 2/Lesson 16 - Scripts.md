# Lesson 16

In this lesson we cover another knowledge representation known as _scripts_ which allow us to make sense of discourses, stories, and scenes using previous concepts (e.g., frames, understanding, and common sense reasoning). We will cover the following:

1. Defining scripts
2. Form vs. content
3. Generating expectations
4. Hierarchies of scripts

## Story Understanding For AI Agents

Stories can help agents make sense of the world and generate expectations. Stories also allows an agent to make connections between events that otherwise might appear separate.

## Definition Of Scripts

A **script** is a knowledge representation for capturing a causally coherent set of events. There are three parts to this definition:

1. **Causally**: each event sets off or causes the next event
2. **Coherent**: the causal connections between events make sense
3. **Events**: the parts are actions or scenes in the world
