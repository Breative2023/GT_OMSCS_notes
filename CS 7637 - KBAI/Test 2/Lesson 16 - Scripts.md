# Lesson 16

In this lesson we cover another knowledge representation known as _scripts_ which allow us to make sense of discourses, stories, and scenes using previous concepts (e.g., frames, understanding, and common sense reasoning). We will cover the following:

1. Defining scripts
2. Form vs. content
3. Generating expectations
4. Hierarchies of scripts

## Story Understanding For AI Agents

Stories can help agents make sense of the world and generate expectations. Stories also allows an agent to make connections between events that otherwise might appear separate.

## Definition Of Scripts

A **script** is a knowledge representation for capturing a causally coherent set of events. There are three parts to this definition:

1. **Causally**: each event sets off or causes the next event
2. **Coherent**: the causal connections between events make sense
3. **Events**: the parts are actions or scenes in the world

## Parts Of A Script

There are six parts to a script:

1. **Entry conditions**: conditions necessary to execute the script
2. **Result**: conditions that will be true after the script has taken place
3. **Props**: objects involved in the execution of the script
4. **Roles**: agents involved in the execution of the script
5. **Track**: variations or _sub-classes_ of the particular script
6. **Scenes**: the sequence of events that occurs during execution of the script

## Using A Script To Generate Expectations

A script can be used to generate expectations since a script may generate a chain of thematic role frames (a scene) which captures a causally coherent set of events. If any of the events in the scene do not occur the agent will know that the outcome is unexpected.

These types of surprises lends itself to the theory of creativity where a situation is creative if it is:

1. Novel
2. Useful or valuable
3. Unexpected or surprising

## Tracks

For each script, there may be different _tracks_ i.e., for a script that is written for _going to a restaurant or food establishment_ there may be a script for going to a coffeehouse, fast food, causal dining, formal dining, etc. Additionally, there may also be a higher level of abstraction for these events, e.g., _going to different types of social events_ not just restaurants.
