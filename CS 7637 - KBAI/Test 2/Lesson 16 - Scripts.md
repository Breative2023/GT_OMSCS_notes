In this lesson we cover another knowledge representation known as _scripts_ which allow us to make sense of discourses, stories, and scenes using previous concepts (e.g., frames, understanding, and common sense reasoning). We will cover the following:

1. Defining scripts
2. Form vs. content
3. Generating expectations
4. Hierarchies of scripts
