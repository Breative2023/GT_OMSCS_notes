# Lesson 17

In _explanation-based learning_ an agent learns about new connections between existing concepts rather than learning about new concepts. Explanation-based learning could be used to introduce the notion of knowledge transfer from an old situation to a new situation. We will cover the following:

1. Concept space
2. Abstraction
3. Analogical transfer

## Concept Space

An agent might represent concepts with facts about a particular concept in the form of a concept space. What prior knowledge does an agent need to build explanations? An agent might have prior knowledge of various concepts such that a causual connection could be made between them.
