# Lesson 6

This week will we cover the following topics:

1. **Direct manipulation** - the user should interact directly with their task
2. **Invisible interfaces** - an interface that disappears between the user and their task

## Direct Manipulation Interfaces

Some lessons from the _Direct Manipulation Interfaces_ paper:

1. **Distance** - the distance between users goals and the system itself. The greater the cognitive load required to use the system, the less direct to the interaction with the system actually feels. Distance can be broken into:
   1. **Semantic distance** - distance between users goals and their expression in the system, i.e., how hard it is to know what to do
   2. **Articulatory distance** - distance between that expression and its execution, i.e., how hard it is to actually do what you know to do
2. **Direct engagement** - systems that best exemplify direct manipulation all give the qualitative feeling that one is engaged with the control of the objects - not with the programs, not with the computer, but with the semantic object of our goals and intentions

## 5 Tips: Invisible Interfaces

How do we accomplish invisible interfaces? Below are five tips:

1. Use affordances
2. Know your user
3. Differentiate your user
4. Let your interface teach
5. Talk to your user

### Reflections: Direct Manipulation

_What is an example of a task you perform regularly that does not leverage the principle of direct manipulation_?

Whenever I use the terminal or command line at work (iTerm) to do web development, it is sometimes difficult to figure out specific commands to run certain applications as there are so many different configurations and details between each one. In addition, debugging applications and trying to figure out what went wrong based on what the terminal displays can sometimes be difficult. As a result, sometimes I spent more time thinking about what to type into the command line versus being able to just get applications to be up and running.

### Exercise: Direct Manipulation

_Which of these Mac touchpad gestures do you think are examples of direct manipulation_?

- Pressing down to click
- Dragging two fingers down to scroll
- Pinching to zoom in and out

### Reflections: Invisibility by Design

_What is a time when you picked up a new interface and knew immediately how to use it to accomplish your goal_?

When using my iTouch for the first time, I really enjoyed how easy it was to select songs, make playlists, conduct searches. For almost everything I wanted to do regarding listening to music, Apple's interface for the iTouch made it a lot easier to do versus older music devices.

### Design Challenge: The Universal Remote

_How would we design an invisible interface for universal remote control, one that doesn't have the learning curves that remotes typically have_?

I think one of the best things Apple did for redesigning the mobile phone and music player interface was to make it touch screen. Similarly if electronic companies like Sony are able to make their remotes touch screen it could make it easier for users to control things like TVs. Another way to do this is through voice control.
