# Lesson 14

In this unit we will cover the following topics:

1. User-centered design
2. Four stages of the design life cycle
3. Qualitative vs. quantitative data
4. Design life cycle

## User-centered Design

In general we can't design great interfaces just by applying guidelines and heuristics. Instead, we have to interact with our users, understand their needs, and involve them in the evaluation process.

- **User-centered design** - design that considers the needs of the user throughout the entire design process

## Principles Of User-centered Design

There are six principles of user-centered design:

1. The design is based upon an explicit understanding of users, tasks, and environments
2. Users are involved throughout design and development
3. The design is driven and refined by user-centered evaluation
4. The process is iterative
5. The design addresses the whole user experience
6. The design team includes multidisciplinary skills and perspectives

## Stakeholders

There are many types of stakeholders who user or are impacted by our interface:

- **Primary** - our user who uses the interface directly
- **Secondary** - are people who don't use our system directly but who might interact with the output of it in some way
- **Tertiary** - are people who never interact with the tool or output but who are nonetheless impacted by the existence of the tool

## The Design Life Cycle

User-centered design is about integrating the user into every phase of the design life cycle. We need to know two things:

1. What the design life cycle is
2. How to integrate the user into each phase

Our model of a design life cycle will cover four phases:

1. **Need-finding** - we gather a comprehensive understanding of the task the users are trying to perform
2. **Design alternatives** - developing very early ideas on the different ways to approach the task
3. **Prototyping** - take the ideas with the most potential and we build them into protoypes that we can then actually put in front of a user
4. **Evaluation** - we take our ideas that we prototyped and put them in front of actual users, here is where we get user feedback

## Methods For The Design Life Cycle

Shown below is the design life cycle with methods in between each phase.

## Qualitative Vs. Quantitative Data

**Quantitative data**:

- Observations described or summarized numerically
- Supports formal tests, comparisons, and conclusions
- Is strong for a small class of things

**Qualitative data**:

- Observations described or summarized non-numerically
- Supports any kind of response or observation
- Covers a broader picture of what we're examining
- Is more prone to biases

**Mixed method**: a mixture of qualitative and quantitative data

## Types Of Nominal Data

There are four main types of quantitative data:

1. Nominal
2. Ordinal
3. Interval
4. Ratio

## Types Of Qualitative Data

There are many types of qualitative data, below are some examples:

1. Transcripts
2. Field notes
3. Artifacts

### Reflections: HCI Methods

_Have you seen places where software engineers, data scientists, or even non-technical people were put in charge of designing user interfaces? How did it go_?

When I used to work for one of the prime defense contractors one of the objectives was to design a rocket according to some technical specifications. While we did have subject-matter experts on our team who lead the mechanical design of components which did fulfill technical specifications. It was clear from the prototype and 1:1 mock-up models that the rockets were not designed with maintenance engineers in mind (I also do not recall ever seeing any manual on the design life cycle and best practices at our facility). Some of the parts on the rocket that were designed to be maintained were in very hard-to-reach areas and some parts were too heavy to be changed out easily. This resulted in extra cost in labor and tools which were designed to help engineers and technicians maintain the product.

### Exercise: Quantitative Vs. Qualitative

_Mark which of these data are quantitative_.

- Responses to: _on a scale of 1 to 5, rate this course's difficulty_
- Responses to : _how much time did you spend per week on this course_?
- _Count students mentioning office hours to the above questions_
- _Percentage of students that completed the survey_
- _The number of participants in a late-semester office hour session_
