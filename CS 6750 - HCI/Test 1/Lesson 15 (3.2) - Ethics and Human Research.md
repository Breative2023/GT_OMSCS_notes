# Lesson 15

In this lesson we will cover the following topics:

1. Origin of research ethics
2. Basic ethical considerations
3. Institutional review board: IRB

## Origin Of Institutional Review Board

Due to unethical experiments such as the _Milgram Experiment_, _Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment_, and _Stanford Prison Experiment_ the _National Research Act_ was enacted (1974). This led to the creation of institutional review boards to oversee research at universities.

In general, the benefits to society must outweigh the risks to the subjects in the case of these experiments.

- **Belmont Report** - summarizes basic ethical principles that research must follow in order to receive government support.

### Exercise: Research Ethics and Industry

_People are still discussing whether or not Facebook's study on its impact on users' moods was ethical. Facebook maintains that the study was consistent with its own data use policy. However, opponents argue that Facebook's study was not. What do you think_?

It may be ethical in the sense that the study was not conducted under an institution which requires informed consent. However, I do think that Facebook needs to do a better job at terms and conditions and allowing users to be informed about the research they are doing rather than using content to manipulate users.
