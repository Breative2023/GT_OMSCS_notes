# Lesson 4

In this lesson we will cover:

1. Focusing on the task
2. Role of the interface in mediating users and tasks
3. The role of the user: Processor? Predictor? Participant?
4. User experience at multiple levels

## Identifying A Task

How do should we go about identifying a task?

1. Watch real users
2. Talk to them
3. Start small
4. Abstract up
5. You are not your user

## Usefulness And Usability

Remember that one of the goals of HCI is to not only make a product that is useful but also useable.

- **Cognitive load** - the total mental effort being used in working memory

## Views Of The User

There are three different roles a human can play:

1. **Processor**:

   - Stems from Behaviorism (observable behaviors and outcomes)
   - Interface must fit within human limits
   - Evaluated by quantitative experiments

2. **Predictor**:

   - Stems from Cognitivism (what goes on in the users mind?)
   - Interface must fit with knowledge
   - Evaluated by qualitative studies

3. **Participant**:

   - Stems from Functionalism (user and the interface are participants in an environment)
   - Interface must fit with the context
   - Evaluated by _in situ_ studies

- **Ex situ** - in a controlled or otherwise inauthentic environment
- **In situ** - within the authentic context

## Section Quizzes

### Exercise: Identifying A Task

_What was the task that Morgan was performing_? Making a purchase

### Reflections: Views Of The User

_When have you encountered these different views in your own history of interacting with computers_?

- Processor: I used to play a hack and slash game where you would be penalized by how fast you could pick up an item that dropped during a game when there were other players in the same game right next to you. At one point players started using auto-pick-up programs to pick up all drops in the game and I felt that dynamic broke the game.
- Predictor: Some navigation devices I have used in the past alert you before the turn and are accurate enough when I am driving in a rural area, however, if my car is moving faster, at times the navigation does not work as well and it's quite annoying to be alerted when you're only _X_ feet away from your turn.
- Participant: I feel that Google Maps has been most consistent with alerting me promptly before my turn or exit and that might be because Google Maps appears to be updated on a regular basis and probably has more data to work with than your typical off-the-shelf navigation which usually does not get updated as often.

### Design Challenge: Morgan On The Street

_What would designing an audiobook for Morgan look like from each of the three perspectives highlighted earlier_?

- Processor: interface should allow Morgan to quickly make a bookmark
- Predictor: interface should allow Morgan to not only make a bookmark but also be able to go back to major sections of any book or where many previous readers have bookmarked
- Participant: interface should suggest, based on data, what books Morgan would like to read based on read books

_How might the design affect user experience at each level_?

- Individual: Morgan could discover books she would not have otherwise discovered
- Group: Morgan could recommend books to her friends and her friends could do the same as well
- Society: People could end up reading more books or at least discovering interesting books they may like and would have otherwise not discovered
