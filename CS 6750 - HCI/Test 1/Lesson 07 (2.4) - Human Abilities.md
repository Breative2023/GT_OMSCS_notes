# Lesson 7

In this lesson we cover the following:

Psychology of what humans can do, we will also cover three systems: input processing, and output.

1. **Input** - how stimuli are sent from the world, and perceived inside the mind
2. **Processing** - cognition, how the brain stores and reasons with over the input it's received
3. **Output** - is how the brain then controls the individual's actions out in the world

## Memory

- **Chunking** - chunking is a grouping together several bits of information into one chunk
- **Perceptual store** - very short term memory lasting less than a second
- **Short-term memory** - memory that is able to hold about four to five chunks at a time
- **Long-term memory** - seemingly unlimited store of memories; it is harder to put things into long-term memory than short-term memory

## Cognition

One of the elements of cognition is _learning_, there are two types:

1. **Procedural learning** - how to do something
2. **Declarative learning** - knowledge about something

When designing user interfaces, cognitive load comes into play as follows:

1. We want to reduce the cognitive load posed by the interface so the user can focus on the task
2. We want to understand the context of what else is going on while users are using our interface

## 5 Tips: Reducing Cognitive Load

1. Use multiple modalities
2. Let the modalities complement each other
3. Give the user control of the pace
4. Emphasize a essential content and minimize clutter
5. Offload tasks

## Conclusion To Human Abilities

Here are some of the main topics covered in this lesson as it relates to human abilities:

- **Perception** - main ways people perceive the world around them through sight, sound, and touch
- **Cognition** - memory and learning
- **Motor system** - how the person interacts with the world around them

## Section Quizzes

### Design Challenge: Message Alerts

_Let's tackle the common problem of being alerted when you've received a text message. The device must alert the user when the phone is in the user's pocket or on the table. It cannot disturb the people around the user (this includes vibrating)_.

We can design the alerts such that the alerts only appear in two scenarios:

1. When the user has the phone on their desk the phone can send flashes or brighten up the screen when a text message is sent, the user's peripheral vision would help detect this alert.
2. Additionally, we can send vibrational alerts when the phone is in her pocket, this way people around her are not bothered

### Memory: Perceptual Store

_What was the score on the board_? The score was 0-0

### Memory: Short-Term And Chunking

_What was the six words in the video_? The six words were, going from top row to bottom: FSDVW, PODAP, PUPPY, POBXC, REXIC, WATCH

### Memory: Short-Term And Recognition

_Which of these words did you see previously_? FSDVW, REXIC, nad PUPPY

### Reflections: Cognitive Load

_Try to think of a task where you've encountered a high cognitive load. What different things did you have to keep in mind at the same time_?

Sometimes when I am trying to help new team members on my web development team, I find it difficult to debug their problem based on the way they have their interface set up. Some people have 20 tabs open on multiple web browsers and others have multiple code editors open at the same time with multiple tabs in each one. This can make it frustrating to actually help them figure out their problem as there are so many distracting windows open at the same time and it's difficult to close each window because it's difficult to know which window the user really needs. I think this issue is a user error first but if the interface was designed such that it is easier to focus on where the issue really is then that would be helpful. The question on how to do this is very difficult because each window that is opened is different, the interface would have to be smart enough to know what problem is to be debugged and present itself.
