# Lesson 9

In this lesson we cover the following on mental models and representations:

1. **Mental model** - an internal, simulatable understanding of external reality
2. **Representations** - internal symbols for an external reality
3. Metaphors and analogies
4. User error: slips and mistakes
5. Learned helplessness
6. Expert blind spot

## 5 Tips: Mental Models For Learnable Interfaces

Below are five tips to leverage for creating learnable interfaces:

1. Predictability
2. Synthesizability
3. Familiarity
4. Generalizability
5. Consistency

## Characteristics Of Good Representations

Here are some characteristics of good representations:

1. Depicts explicit relationships
2. Brings objects and relationships together
3. No extraneous information
4. Expose natural constraints

## Analogies And Metaphors

If you can ground your interface in something users already know, you can get a solid foundation in teaching them how to use your interface. However, when you use analogies to other interfaces, users may not know where the analogy ends. Therefore, we should pay special attention to misconceptions analogies introduce.

Analogies make the interface more learnable, but they may restrict the interface to outdated constraints.

## Design Principles Revisited

How do mental models and representations tie into HCI design principles?

- Analogies and metaphors - principle of consistency
- Interfaces should teach the user how the system works - principle of affordances
- Representations map the interface to the task at hand - principle of mapping

## User Error: Slips And Mistakes

Two types of user error:

- **Slips** - the user has the right mental model, but does the wrong thing anyway
  - **Action-based** - places where the user performs the wrong action, or performs the right action on the wrong object, even though they knew the correct action
  - **Memory lapse** - occurs when the user forgets something they knew to do
- **Mistakes** - the user has the wrong mental model, and does the wrong thing as a result
  - **Rule-based** - occurs when the user correctly assesses the state of the world but makes the wrong decision based on it
  - **Knowledge-based** - occur when the user incorrectly assesses the state of the world in the first place
  - **Memory lapse** - similar to memory lapse slips but focuses on forgetting to fully execute a plan

## Learned Helplessness

What happens when there is no useful feedback between the user's input and the interface's output?

- **Learned helplessness** - a user's sense that they are helpless to accomplish their goals in an interface

## Expert Blind Spot

When you are an expert in something there are parts of the task that you do subconsciously without even thinking about them.

## Section Quizzes

### Representations For Problem Solving 1

_Was the hiker ever at the same point at the same time on both days_?

Yes, there is a point in time where he would have to pass himself but this is hard to see without a representation of the person going up and also a representation of the person going back down at the same time.

### Representations For Problem Solving 2

_How many moves does it take to solve the circles and squares problem_?

It would take 11 or more moves. Here is an [example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2Nh4aBdSyM).

### Design Challenge: Representations

_How can we make this representation of what each breaker corresponds to better_?

We could make the icons for each object or room next to each breaker or digitize the interface so that if configurations change at the circuit breaker level the digital interface to configure each breaker remains the same.

### Exercise: Slips Vs. Mistakes

_Morgan accidentally sends a text message to the wrong person, is this a slip or a mistake_?

A slip, she knows who she means to message but the phone's behavior tricks her into sending things to the wrong people

### Quiz: Expert Blind Spot

We must always remember that we are not our users.

### Reflections: Learned Helplessness And Expert Blind Spot

_Reflect on a time when you experienced learned helplessness and the effects of expert blind spot from someone trying to teach you something_.

We do a lot of technical solutioning and _hacks_ at while at work in order to create a feature for our software product. There are many times when I would ask a lead engineer how I should approach the problem or direction but because of their expert blind spot they would explain the approach in such a way that the useful details actually get lost in translation or more commonly, they would assume that I already know some of the acronyms that they use in their explanation. Unfortunately, the latter is a very common occurrence based on my own observations in the technical world and causes learned helplessness and _imposter syndrome_ for most new employees.
